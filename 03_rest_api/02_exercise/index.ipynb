    "1. Create a ```webapi``` project named ```App``` and then:\n",

    "   - Move the sample ```WeatherForecast``` class to the new ```Utils``` library project\n",
    "   - Add sample tests for the ```Utils``` library in new ```Test``` project\n",
    "   - Add the ```FxCopAnalyzers``` package with code analyzers\n",
    "   - Treat warnings as errors\n",
    "   - Use nullable references\n",
    "   - Fix analysis issues in Rider IDE\n",
    "   - Make sure that application works correctly!\n",

    "   - Is it possible to 100% cover the code with tests? If not, which parts should be excluded?\n",
    "   - Hints:\n",
    "     - Tests should be in the ```Test``` project and the controller in the ```App ``` project\n",
    "     - You can add reference from ```Test``` to the ```App ``` project\n",

    "3. Use EF to store ```WeatherForecast``` objects in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The database can be populated when the ```Post``` method is called (must be added in the controller).\n",
    "   - Retrieving data in the ```Get``` (existing) method will be as simple as reading from the database.\n",
    "   - You can use the code from previous exercises.\n",
    "   - Remember to update unit tests"
